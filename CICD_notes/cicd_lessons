CI 
# Continous Integration
# Strategy Of DevOps
# CI is all about integrating live changes of source code into Master/production/release after being validated and tested

Porperties
1:changes push shoud be small unlike in agile they are huge 
2: changes that we move should be capable enough to test functionality 

Example Arthimetic calculations 
+-*/

+==> -==> *==. /==>

3: frequency of changes deployed shoud be more regular 
4:entaire of process build test pachage release automated 
5: CI if fails rollback 


CD 

Coninous Development
continouse delivery 
continous deployment 

Continous Delivery 
is all about to make your deliverable in ready mode waiting for approval for deploymnet in production / release cycle. 
Deployment should happen in automated mode
Changes should be small / minor 
Int. Question - Diff between CI and CD.

  Q. What is CI and CD ?

          History Of Jenkins

engineer student  2003-04 - Japan - name: kawaguchi
College Project with 4 members
After done with college, continued with project and created a new tool in build process that could compete existing licensed build tools
Sun Microsystems offered jobs in 2006.
Tool - named as hudson 2008 - sun microsystems released in 2008.
Open source → hudson  under sun microsystems - 2008 - 2009
2009 - Sun Microsystems was purchased by Oracle

Kawaguchi team quit jobs in oracle
2011 - 2013 - jenkins  
2013 - release a new tool - Jenkins as open source

Jenkins System Requirements

1 GB RAM free available
50 GB HDD
Java JDK 1.8 or JRE 1.8 installed or above
Recommended to install JDK version of Java



Step 1 - download Java from below site 

https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html

Step 2 - Install it after download.

Next .. next…finish

Step 3 -- Configure Java

Jenkins System Requirements

1 GB RAM free available
50 GB HDD
Java JDK 1.8 or JRE 1.8 installed or above
Recommended to install JDK version of Java



Step 1 - download Java from below site 

https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html
Step 2 - Install it after download.

Next .. next…finish

Step 3 -- Configure Java

Step -- Open site of git and install git

Step = Open site of jenkins and download jar file of LTS type


Step == Command to start the jenkins

# java -jar jenkins.war


** Default port number of Jenkins → 8080

** can we start the jenkins on non default port → Yes

** access the jenkins
Open browser
IPaddress_server:portnumber
** Jenkins operates on web server called “Jetty”

Example : localhost:8080

** Put the password into below screen
 Download,Install, Configure of Java JDK - Linux OS

Step 1 -	

Download Java from Oracle site

    https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html

Step 2 -		

Download " Linux x64 Compressed Archive " using  oracle ID and password

Step 3 -

 File gets downloaded onto the Windows computer.
 Need to transfer the file to Linux PC using either Winscp or scp command or Mobaxterm

     Note: 

   scp Command Method :

    # scp source_file userid@target_ip:targetpath

make sure to fire this command from ur source computer ( from where java downloaded computer)

Step 4 : 

After the transfer JDK file to linux os under /opt/java folder

    # cd /opt/java

# ls -l

    <file_downloaded>

    # tar -xvf <file_downloaded>

    # ls -l

Note : 	make a note of java version that got installed / Untarred

Example:  <java_installed_version>



Step 5: Configuration

Below is the Java configuration Template

For java

# update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /opt/java/<java_installed_version>/bin/java 100
# update-alternatives --config java

For JAVAC

# update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /opt/java/<java_installed_version>/bin/javac 100  
# update-alternatives --config javac

For JAR

# update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/jar jar /opt/java/<java_installed_version>/bin/jar 100  
# update-alternatives --config jar


Step 6 - Exporting  Java Environment Variables


# export JAVA_HOME=/opt/java/<java_installed_version>/
# export JRE_HOME=/opt/java/<java_installed_version>/jre
# export PATH=$PATH:/opt/java/<java_installed_version>/bin:/opt/java/<java_installed_version>/jre/bin

Step 7 - Verify

# java -version

expected o/p:

java version "1.8.0_301"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_291-b09)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.291-b09, mixed mode)

Java Configuration in Linux Instance - AWS Cloud

Install Java JDK version
Find all java versions at cd /usr/lib/jvm
Write below values -  into file /etc/profile at the end of file

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/<java_version_installed>
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin


# source /etc/profile or logout and login back
Verify # java -version


Installation of Jenkins - Linux OS

Step 1 - Create jenkins folder under /opt

    		# cd /opt
Installation of Jenkins - Linux OS

Step 1 - Create jenkins folder under /opt

    		# cd /opt
   # mkdir jenkins

    		# cd jenkins

Step 2 - Get the LTS, war file URL from Official Jenkins site

    		# wget URL_Jenkins_War_file

Step 3 - Start Jenkins

    		# java -jar jenkins.war    	 
   	 		....
   			 ....
      		Jenkins is fully up and running

  Step 4 - open the any browser on windows pc, put below

     		ipaddress_jenkins_server:port number

    		example : 192.168.0.8:8080


Note - 

* jenkins starts on default port 8080
* if we get "connection timed out" then stop firewall
 # service firewalld stop

Step 5 - Unlock jenkins

    * the password to unlock jenkins will be available at    		 
   	 /root/.jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

    # cat <password file>

    example : #  cat /root/.jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

    Step 6 -  Select Plugin

 "select suggested plugins to install"

***GUIDELINES OF SELECTING PLUGIN's for your TASK in PROJECT ****

1. Complete information about what you do for a task. (objective)

2. Think about it, search on google for the keywords of your task.

3. (hint), make a list of all the plugins(4/5) that are required for your task.

4. ur duty, to check with document of those plugins and also reviews those plugin

   	 document 4/5 -  2/3

   	 reviews on those 2/3 plugin's : - best one*

   	 *** check with your senior devops eng and take the decisions


OR
directly we will directions from archtectural team about plugins to install


Q. How do you open the documentation of a plugin ?

    click on plugin >> wiki page of jenkins plugins >>


Q. will documentation helps you ?
    
    50 % - 70%  ( read the document couple of times )

    ** assistance : google, and youtube

Q. ** plugins installations are two types -

    1. Simply install the plugin
    
    2. install, and also configure it after install

    How come we know what method to be followed ?

    reference documentation only.

Q. Do we have like any test env setup of jenkins to try all these things in real time?

    Yes. ( 99 % ) - try and see ..

Q. What is the ideal time to install the plugin's and configure it on live build server ?

    ** install/confgure the plugins when builds are not running.

    else

    *** there is high probability that running builds will fail

note: can be ignored if the task is of critical

====== TOPIC : JOB CREATION PROCESS IN JENKINS ==========================

Q. what happens when we start the jenkins without port number ?

    it starts on a default port number 8080

Q. use case --> plugin -->

    no plugin -- available on internet
1. download plugin and upload in jenkins 1%

    2. plugin for project --

   	plugin jenkins - .hpi ( hudson packer installer)

Q. What tabs are available when a project/job is created ?

    1. General
    2. Source Code Management
    3. Build Triggers
    4. Build Environment
    5. Build
    6. Post Build Actions



Note - * We configure the options under those tabs based on requirement/demand. It implies that configurations are optional in nature.

Q. What happens while the storage capacity ( Disk) of the build server becomes full ?

    1. Errors/notification
    2. All builds will go into Queue
    3. The builds are in process execution they will run forever

Q. What is the meaning of trigger in jenkins?
  Trigger is an interaction between Jenkins and code
    
    or

    it tells about when to fire the code

    or
    
    it tells about when the event of build process should happen
