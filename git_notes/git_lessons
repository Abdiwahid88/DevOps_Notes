  # git init <local_repo_name>
=================================================================================

Git - Project / Local Repository Creation Use cases

Q. How do you verify if that folder is a git repo or not ?

    method 1
  cd into folder then

 # ls -la  

 we should see .git folder

    method 2 # 

cd into folder then

 # git status 

we will get some response

Q. How many projects/repositories can we create on the client side ?

    unlimited.

Q. Will you create a project/repo inside of another repo on the client side?

    no.

Q. What are two commands which can be executed irrespective of repo or project ?

    # git --version

    # git config --list

*** we will find .git folder which is hidden exists in a local repo/git project

Q. linux ls -l and ls -la

Ls -l   will show all files and folders
Ls -la  will show all files and folders including hidden one’s as well

Q. Do we have to create repo in the root folder only or can we create repo at any location?

    Location does not matter
==================================================================================

 GIT - Commit Changes

Q. How to do a single commit ?
# git add <filename>

    # git commit -m "message" <filename>

Q. How to commit more than one file ?

it will pick up all the files which are staged or indexed,move to CA

	ABOUT WDC / WTC

***Q. Why Working directory clean ( linux ) messages ?

   WTC  -- Working tree is clean ( windows)

* we get the message under two conditions.

  1st - 	WD/WC == CA

***file content Level***

  2nd - 	if number of files in stage = 0

 both 1st and 2nd conditions have to be true.

Cloud Hosting of Remote Repo

Use case 1 -

if your org, has own server - then we do not need github, bit bucket, etc

Use Case 2 - 

if your org wants to host the repo on a third party server then need cloud vendors who support remote repo on lease.
ex - github, bit bucket, assembla, gitlab etc

- challenges of hosting, Remote Repo on Own Server

1. security
2. availability
3. down time
4. network issues
5. maintenance
6. cost
7. OS license
8. resources to manage it
9. Backup
Repo Types with Cloud Vendors

Remote Repos are of two types:

    1. public Repo
   	 - free
   	 - limit in space
   	 - repo count
   	 - accessed by any person who has a github account.
          - Suitable for open source.

    2. Private repo
   	 - pay for using private repo
   	 - all features apply
   	 - Private repo can be accessed only by authorized persons
    
Realtime: when you join any project, they share your github id and password.

Note : 

* all non-critical or medium critical repos are generally hosted on cloud

* All critical data of repo's are hosted on their own server.

Github - Account Creation

Q. How to create the repo in github?

-- login into github
-- then create new
-- give a name to it
-- readme file - you can update about information over their


Q. How to clone a remote repo onto your computer ?

 # git clone <repo_URL>

Note -
When we clone public repo, it will not ask any git hub ID and github password (Token)
When we clone private repo, it will ask your github  ID and github password (Token)

Q. How to identify the repo which is clone or remote origin ??

   	 # git remote -v

   	 or
   	 
 # git config --list

we will get the details of remote links

Q. How to pull the updates from remote repo ?

   	 # git pull

Q. How to update the changes from local to remote repo ?

   	 # git push

Note : REPO -- create -- for push -- create access key 

PROFILE → settings >> Developer settings → Generate new Token →

Need Token to perform action of git push. Refer to below link to about github token creation process.

https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-personal-access-token

Q. How to commit the changes to the server side ?

    1. commit changes on local repo

    2. git pull      →  	to pick up updates from server to LR
    
    3. git push   → 	to pick up updates from LR to Server

============  07 June 2023 =================

Git - Branching

Branch uses :
   
    1. code experimentation
    2. apply changes on existing code
    3. testing the code
    4. debugging the code

Q. How to know the branch info ?

# git branch
or

# git status

Q. how to know the current branch info ?

# git branch

* indicates the current branch

2nd : # git status

    on branch <....>

Q. How to create a branch?

# git branch <br_name>

Q. How to move into another branch ?

# git checkout <br_name>

Q. How to merge the changes into parent ?

# git merge <br_name>

    ** Usually, we merge the child branch into the parent.

    case 1. Can you merge a child into another parent ?

   		 yes, but there is high probability conflicts

Q. How to delete the branch ?

    ** we can only delete the child branches.

    # git branch -d <br_name>

Q. How to rename a branch ?

    # git branch -m oldname newname

Q. Can we rename a main or master branch ?

    # yes
Note : normally in IT projects they void renaming the main or master branch.

    # git branch

error : git push

Q. Do you think merge and push are the same ?

push - local - to server

merge - branch to LR

Q. Do we create a branch within other branch?
  Yes, but make sure we merge the changes in its parent

Q. Is there any real time use case, where we push the code to the repo from the branch instead of main?

We can do, but this will not a process in R.T


Q. developers only create the local branches right, so what is the role of a devops engineer there ?

          CONCEPT - GIT IGNORE

*** git ignore  ****

repo -- file -- if we do not want to apply any VCS, then we should update the file name in gitignore

gitignore is a file

1. excluded from VCS
2. those files will not be uploaded to the server, not part of pull and push...
3. any changes that we make to gitignore, we have to commit the changes...

-- 99 % times, when project is created, .gitignore

-- use cases:

1. development files are still pending or yet to complete

2. users will try to maintain there notes of the project

3. Userid and password files

4. junk/temp files of the project

5. not required files

Note: ** git will not apply any VCS on a folder which is empty.
Q. What happens when you put a file in git ignore that is already being tracked?


Q. what if .gitignore itself is included in the .gitignore file


Topic - Git Diff

1. git diff

- it will compare the data of committed file with a modified file

or

- it will compare the data that is in CA to that of WD/WC

Position : The file should not be staged

Green : it has been just added but not yet committed

white : it has been committed ; sits on wc/wd and CA
Red : the content was already committed and we are trying to remove it in WD/WC

2. git diff --staged

use this command only when we stage the modified file.

it will compare file/content in stage to that CA

Case study::
-----------

git will not track any folder which is empty

git will work on content basis


Q. How to set the color high lighting in Git ?

# git config --global color.ui true

# git config --global color.status auto
# git config --global color.branch auto

Red color - File - untracked or modified or line in a file has been deleted

Green Color - File is staged or a Line in a file has been added


Home work --

git rebase -
git switch -
git stash -
git reflog -

Project --

1. create a Remote Repo let us say "xyz" - add readme and .gitignore file

2. in xyz, create two files and commit them in xyz

3. now, clone it on your machine

4. on our machine -- xyz, then create another 4 files with some sample data in local side

5. do git pull and push activity

Project 2 --

1. Create a Remote Repo let us say "abc" - add readme and .gitignore file

2. in abc, create three files with some sample data in it and commit them.

3. Now, create a Local Repo "def", here add some files with some data

4. Now, link "def" with "abc"

5. complete pull and push activity
