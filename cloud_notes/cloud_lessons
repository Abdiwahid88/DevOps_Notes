Private Cloud
Public Cloud
Hybrid Cloud
Social / Community  Cloud
					Private Cloud

		* client/server - 1973 IBM, released to market in 1978

	   	* Accessing resources using a private network on demand is called as private cloud

		* Example : Project - Travel - to office - and work.
* Novel Networks - 1990

		* Dell(EMC) and IBM are leaders currently..

		1990 - VPN - "Virtual Private Network"

	To Access a private network of an organization using a public network is VPN.
	
						 Public cloud 

		* Accessing resources using Public network on demand --> public cloud

		* post internet evolution : 1994, (India 1996)

		internet - UN - 1987 - connecting all networks of world, 1992 - 1993  

		ICANN -: 1994  USA, Russia, European ( 1994, 1995 ) ( India - 1996 )

		* Accessing resources over public network (internet) on demand based 		  	it is called as "public cloud"

		* existence from 1996 ....

* Here, using these services we need to pay --? " PAY PER USE MODEL "

1. Charge based on usage
2. pay it after using resources (POST payment)
3. No deposit or investment

*Amazon --> 1996 --> retail --> 2002-2003--> IT business - Cloud ( 2004 ) "amazon"
*2006 - AWS - amazon web services
2009-10 - largest public cloud vendor - 85 %

2010 - microsoft - Azure
2012 - IBM - Bluemix
2013 - Oracle - Oracle Cloud
2014 - Google - GCP
2015-16 - Dell + Apache Foundation + etc → PCF  ( Pivotal Cloud Foundry )

2020 - 68 % - aws ;; 12 % azure
Hybrid cloud

	*combination of private cloud and public cloud in a organization
		
	* example: Banks, University, Netflix, Microsoft, AWS, Jio, 
		       : 95 % going now... 

* Exception : Defense

 Community Cloud

	* It is also called  the Social Cloud.

	* is similar to public cloud, but they operate on a non-pay service model.

	* cloud, but a use cases of open source

 					Cloud - Advantages		

1. cost reduction in  IT operations

2. Accessibility from anywhere

	australia - india - cloud - online - resources -
3. Availability of Resources on demands - 24 * 7 * 365

4. ** Up front Investment not required 

Use case :   	Start up companies - boom
 			lease - resources - use it  - pay per use - after the use....

Use case :		Netflix - World movie website - own servers - cloud 100%

5. Maintenance headache are gone 

	traditional - buy servers - setup - maintain
		
	cloud - vendor - demand of resources - enjoy services - ** cost reduction

6. 	Cloud vendors - they will take care of end to end activities like - 

 Updates
 Disaster mgmt
 Support
 License cost 
Data Mgmt etc

7. Cloud vendors offer a lot of services

8. It is a boom for the companies to focus on their core competency.

Ex- pharma companies


Cloud - Concerns

1. the internet is  a dependency, some parts of the world still do not have internet access.

	Example: South African countries, cloud still a question

2. broadband internet - slowness - 

3. Vendor - 24 * 7 -- > service issues - * down time - concern for ur business

	Unplanned - concern

4. *** vendor lock in issue ***

--> 2020 - azure - setup -- using -- not satisfied --> 2021 - aws --> down times ** 3 days **

	- sneap deal - azure --> 2021 - aws -- down time - 3 days

	7 --5 -3 --> 1 to 3 days...;; Live migration (chargeable)

5. Cloud - 100 % not flexible or not custom
tradition --> custom - will --> 100 %
	
	cloud --> 100 % --> 95 % is possible

6. Security of services on cloud, ---> 
	
	* Every thing happens on trust factor bt u and vendor

        * fb -> cabdrige university 
	
	* Microsoft --> 15000 indian clients data was leaked ( Dec 2020 / Jan 2021 )

7. Services - variances - prices - Features

8. **IT companies are losing experience of traditional IT, because of Cloud vendor

	netflix - 100 % cloud - cloud close their shop..

Example : Script med -- 2 versions - 1st SME (traditional) ;; 2nd - SMC - AWS, AZURE, PCF, ** GCP -

data - tradtional - -> cloud (balance)

***** Public cloud services: ( pay per use model )  ***** 

1. IAAS - infrastructure as a service
* client --> vendor ( AWS ) --> hardwares ;; 
* client will have to setup rest of things ( OS Setup , Application Setup, etc )

	--> AWS is a leader
	--> 2005, Microsoft was largest holder of Data centers, 2018 AWS Largest data centers holder, 6X (Report - GARNER)
	

2. PAAS - Platform as a service

* client --> will get from cloud vendor ( hardware + os )

* client will have to setup the application

	---> both AWS/azure are same page.


3. SAAS - Software as a service

client --> app (billing/hotels) --> cloud vendor (AWS)--> 'modelled applications'

	--> customize for u --> application --> use it. -->  Pay it

If SAAS was not there, alt.solution: { IT company, Hire developer, self }

	-- client zero maintainence -- pay for it.

--> *SALES FORCE is a leader, AWS, Oracle

	---> 1996, force.com --> infosys, IBM, --> technology SAAS

4. XAAS - "Everything as a service"

     --> service, whatever client asks - cloud provide - hardware, application, network, support, etc

	--> IBM is a leader

Other services -

** NAAS - Network  as a service
** DBAAS - Database as a service
** DAAS - Database as a service
** CAAS - Container as a Service
** FAAS - Fileserver as a service
** VAAS - VCS as a service    

Introduction to AWS 


2004, cloud business with brand Amazon
SQS - Simple Queue Service - 1st Service by AWS
2006 Dec, they started a another business unit, "AWS" - amazon web services 
Journey 2004 - by 2010- leaders in cloud
cloud 62 % hold of market holding according GARNER reports, 2020 year
Volume Of business - higher side

Why AWS Popular 

 Best Support
 Less downtimes,  ( Compare -- aws and azure )
 Price - aws is cheapest one
Operates on pay per use model  
AWS currently offering 1 year free subscription with some free services but with limitation. 
Popular Services -- SQS, Ec2, S3, RDS etc

** startup companies -- free offers - Example: Ec2, DB, etc

survey -- company 100 rupees ;; aws - best benefit - 40 %  

Case study: 

Use - dell - Pivotial Cloud Foundry - free hardwares / EC2 - Dell 6  servers - as built servers 

*** AWS Creation Progress ***

Referlink: 

https://support.sou.edu/kb/articles/amazon-web-services-account-creation

- aws - free 1 year free services but limitations
- email id, phone, credit/debit - 2 charge u/ return 2 in 15 wd
- Ruy card - will not work**
- once you complete the registration part, you will get the email from AWS.
- Activate email that you get. After few minutes, another aws email -- "success/failed" - 
login link --> web page --> "aws web console login"

ur account -- my account -- if I create some other users -- IAM USER

Computer - system admin ;; -->users


After login:
1st - you switch to right region
2nd - select the required services that we are about to create
3rd - 

AWS - EC2 Chapter.

Services - free, limited, billing.

refer to documents of AWS - service. 

Introduction to EC2

EC2 - Elastic Cloud compute
if we create a computer online and access it from anywhere -- "online virtual server"
Ec2 - is all about creating an online virtual server, which can be accessed over the internet.
Ec2 - comes under free tier services but with some limitation

1. Choose AMI (Amazon Machine Image)  - select the OS
2. Choose Instance Type - Hardware ( CPU, RAM, STORAGE DISK, MOTHERBOARD TYPES)
3. Configure Instance -  .. simply .. next
4. Add Storage - Space needed for HDD disk
5. Add Tags - Names ur computers
6. Configure Security Group - setup of ports
7. Review - 

keypair(password)-file-download--> called as PEM File
Privacy Enhanced mail.

Ec2 - create -will two IP address: IPV4

	1. Private IP
	2. Public IP

-> to connect Ec2, we are supposed to use Public IP v4
--> Talk from one Ec2 to another Ec2 - use Private IP v4

What details u have about Ec2?

	- IP public v4
	- password ( pem file )
	- login ID 
	- App to connect - gitbash, putty


# ssh login_id@ipv4address -i <pemfile>

* When we are using putty, we need ppk file and not pem file.
* AWS --> download --> pem file --> puttygen converts pem into ppk

Site: https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html

* using ppk in putty, we need connect to AWS Ec2

** Process to convert pem into ppk file **

1. open puttygen
2. click on Load and browse to pem file
3. click on Save Private key

Note : Restart the computer..

              Connect EC2- Linux Instance using Putty

1. make sure we have ppk file ready

2. Open putty, put the userid@public_Ipv4_AWS_Ec2_instance

3. Then, expand "connection" then expand "SSH"

4. Now, select "AUTH", browse to ppk file.
